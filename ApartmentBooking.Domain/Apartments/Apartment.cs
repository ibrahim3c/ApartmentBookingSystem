            This approach follows Clean Architecture and DDD best practices 
                by ensuring that the only way to modify an entity is through controlled domain logic methods
                rather than direct property assignments.
            Encapsulation           → Prevents direct modification from outside the entity.
            Enforces Business Rules → Updates must follow controlled logic.
            Ensures Data Integrity  → Prevents invalid or null values.
            Promotes Immutability   → Read-only properties make the entity more predictable.
            Prevents Bugs & Side Effects → No unexpected changes from external code.
